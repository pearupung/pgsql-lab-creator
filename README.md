# PGSQL Lab Creator

At university I often times sat in a lab behind a computer with no feeling of order - everybody paced themselves and the ones that needed help were in disarray. Managing a classroom is hard and managing a computer classroom without knowledge who needs help or who is behind is *crippling*. For me, at least. This project:

1. sets up an empty PGSQL instance that everybody can log into and complete a lab
2. sets up automatic monitoring based on some example database and gives feedback on how well the students are progressing

The live demo will be hosted as soon as I have made enough progress on it.
